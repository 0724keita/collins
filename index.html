          <h2>About</h2>
	  <p>
	  Collins started as a system to manage all of the physical servers, switches,
	  racks, etc in Tumblr production environments. As we started to
	  inventory hardware, IP addresses, software, and so on, we found the API and
	  data gave us an excellent way to drive automation processes. Today Collins can
	  do push button cluster (HBase, Hadoop, web, etc) deployment, drive configuration
	  generation when hardware cluster topologies change, drive infrastructure updates
	  when software configuration changes, and help manage software deploys.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Because of the loosely coupled design of Collins, consistently applied
	  conventions are a system requirement. This document serves as a guide
	  to those conventions as well as the basic core concepts of the collins system.

          </p>

          <h2>Approach</h2>
	  <p>Collins is extremely dumb. It knows about assets, their
	  meta-data and asset logs. You can think of collins as a key/value
	  store where each asset has its own set of key/value pairs. There are
	  no relationships between assets other than the ones you, through
	  convention, derive. The API makes it trivial to create and manage
	  the tags (meta-data, key/value pairs) associated with an asset, and
	  to query based on those tags.
	  </p>
	  <p>Collins is intentionally dumb. It worries about basic
	  authentication, clean API interactions, and data persistence. If you
	  start thinking, "Hey, I should build X into Collins", you probably
	  shouldn't. Collins supports both a plugins architecture (for things
	  that actually in some way change the behavior of collins) as well as
	  a very usable API (including clients in Python, Ruby and Bash).
	  Nearly everything you might want to do can be accomplished via the
	  API and anything that can't is doable as a plugin.

          <h2>Motivations</h2>
          <p>
	  We looked at a dozen or so open source and commercial products before coding began.
	  Having an API and workflow flexibility were requirements. The intake support for our
	  specific hardware intake process also needed to be accounted for. We also needed
	  something that would support not just virtualized systems, but was more tailored
	  towards physical hardware. We found nothing that met the requirements we had.
	  Things we looked at included:
	  </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><a href="http://openstack.org/">openstack</a></li>
	      <li><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/Orchestra">Ubuntu Orchestra</a></li>
	      <li><a href="https://forms.raritan.com/products/data-center-infrastructure-management/dctrack/">dcTrack</a></li>
	      <li><a href="http://iptrack.sourceforge.net/">IPplan</a></li>
	      <li><a href="http://opennetadmin.com/">OpenNetAdmin</a></li>
	      <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/openipam/">openIPAM</a></li>
	      <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/spoiled/">Spoled</a></li>
	    </ul>
	  <p>
	    Some of these are strictly for IPAM, some handled parts of what collins does. None of these were good fits for the
	    initial problems we were trying to solve.
