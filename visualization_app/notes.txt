This is the front end of a tool that will show the status of the individual
boxes while showing the layout of the datacenter.

The css elements used are:

    control_container and control - A panel that will contain the control
    elements for the tool.

    contain_rows: Contains all of the elements that represent the datacenter.

    datacenter_rows: Rows in the datacenter, 4 rows at the moment. Contains 
    racks.

    racks: Containing chasses. 10 racks per row. Shows rack number above
    chasses.

    chassis: Containing nodes and powerelems. 18 chasses per racks.

    powerelem: Element to indicate where the power supply is in the chassis for
    orientation. 2 powerelem per chassis. May show U height.

    node: Element to represent node. 4 nodes per chassis. May show asset number.
    Please refer to html to understand node numbering. Nodes are color-coded to
    show status:
        Blue - Unallocated
        Green - New
        Yellow - Incomplete
        Red - Not Found
        Grey - Everything else
    In order to keep everything rendering correctly, if a node isn't found
    then a node should still be rendered but without a status color. It will
    show up as a hole that way, and the hole will be in the right spot.

There are a few user interface elements to note:

    To move from row to row, use vertical scroll (within the invisible
    contain_rows).

    To move within a row, use horizontal scroll.

    Single click on an asset opens up collins page for that asset (currently
    just opens collins docs in a new tab).

    Holding mouse down for 1 second on an asset starts the IPMI Identify
    function (currently just triggers an alert).

Other suggested UI elements include:

    A refresh button (if the page ends up being static)

    A toggle to grey for all elements of a certain type (ie. I only want to see
    the Incomplete elements)
