## Overview

Collins Query Language is a new feature in Collins for performing advanced
searches on assets using a DSL similar to the WHERE clause of a typical SQL
statement.  

## Basic Queries

### Key/values

Any primary value (tag, status, type, etc.) or attribute can be searched on

- key names are case insensitive
- any string values that are one word don't need quotes
- wildcards are supported at the beginning and/or end of string values

Some example queries:

    tag = "test1"
    tag = test1
    tag = test*
    tag = *1
    TAG = test1

All keys are typed (although most are still defaulting to string)

    total_disk_size = 12345 //ok
    total_disk_size = foobar //error

### Keys with Enumerated values
TYPE and STATUS only accept certain values (case insensitive)

    TYPE = SERVER_NODE //ok
    TyPe = SeRvEr_nOdE //ok
    TYPE = FOO //not ok

### Ranges

All values support ranges

    CPU_CORES = [4,8]
    CPU_CORES = [*,10]
    TAG = ["foo","foz"]

### Logical Operators

CQL allows for queries that consist of arbirary boolean expressions on asset data.

    IP_ADDRESS = 192.168.* OR IP_ADDRESS = 10.60.*
    
    TYPE = SERVER_NODE AND NOT TAG = foo-*
    
    STATUS = UNALLOCATED OR (STATUS = ALLOCATED AND IP_ADDRESS = 192.168.*)

To find assets that don't have a certain attribute set, simply do

    NOT attribute = *
    
Order of operations is standard for boolean expressions

    NOT foo = bar AND bar = baz OR bar = asdf  <--> ((NOT foo = bar) AND bar = baz) OR bar = asdf

### Other details

- Any key can be used to sort results, using the --sort_field option
- When a new attribute is created on-demand, its type defaults to String.  
- There is a special "KEYS" attribute that simply contains all of the keys set
  on the asset.  Can be useful for doing wildcard searches on key names

## Using CQL 

### How to make CQL queries in collins_shell

    collin_shell asset find --selector='query:"status = unallocated AND ip_address = [192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.100]"' 

### In the web app

There's currently no form for inputting a query in the web app, but the url endpoint is
