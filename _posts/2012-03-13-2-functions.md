## Basic Functions of Collins

Collins is very simple and only has a few things actually built into it. These
are:

 * Provisioning Servers
 * Cancelling Servers
 * Searching for Servers
 * Power management for servers
 * Viewing and searching for logs

Literally everything else is built as an add-on to collins. One other thing to note is that nearly
every action in collins creates an audit trail of which user took which action.

## Login

[Login](http://collins.tumblr.net:8080) here. If you need a username/password, see Blake or Ken. The login backend
supports both LDAP and flat files, at SoftLayer we use flat files. You should be presented with a screen like the
following:

<a href="images/collins_login.png"><img src="images/collins_login.png" width="599" height="267"></a>

Login is required to do anything in collins, there is no functionality available to anonymous users.

## Search

Once logged in you should see an interface similar to the following:

<a href="images/collins_search.png"><img src="images/collins_search.png" width="598" height="617"></a>

Here you can search for assets that match the criteria you specify. Since we're looking for a server to provision,
we're going to look for unallocated server nodes. You'll see in the above image that I have selected those values
from the available drop downs. You'll see search results like the following:

## Asset Details

Once you click through to an asset you're interested in you're provided a variety of details about that asset.

<a href="images/collins_asset.png"><img src="images/collins_asset.png" width="598" height="573"></a>

The overview tab provides general details about the asset such as the hostname, status, any user supplied notes as well
as a hardware overview (not shown) which includes information such as amount of RAM or number of CPU's. The formatting of each
tag is declared in the application configuration as a decorator. Decorators are available for links, images, and many other
formats.

The IPMI info tab provides remote console access to the asset if it's enabled.

The logs tab shows all historical log information for that asset.

## Asset Actions

The actions that are available on a particular asset depend both on the asset type as well as the status. For instance, you can not provision
an asset that is already allocated. You can not put a host into maintenance mode that is already in maintenance mode. For the most part,
applicable actions are available only when they are, well, applicable.

You can find the available asset actions in the actions drop down.

Note that everything below the divider line is a potentially destructive or disruptive action and will be called out as such in the
UI.

## Provisioning

For provisioning purposes you'll want to search for hosts that are unallocated. Although technically you can provision
incomplete hosts, these will pull servers from the spare pool which causes a variety of backend processes to kick off.
In general, operations people should be the only ones pulling assets out of the spare pool.

To provision a host just click the 'Provision Server' link in the actions drop down. You will be presented with a dialog
like the following:

<a href="images/collins_provision.png"><img src="images/collins_provision.png"></a>

Depending on the profile you choose (web, database, etc) you will have a different set of configurable options made
available to you. The profile and options you specify will dictate what role in the environment the host will eventually
play. If something is optional (such as secondary role in this dialog) and you're unsure, just leave it unspecified.

When you're ready just click the 'Provision Server' button. This takes 30-60 seconds to return. During this process we
verify any required settings for the specified host and reboot it onto a reinstall image. Once control is returned to
you, the dialog will close and you should notice that the primary role, pool, nodeclass, contact and some other options
have been changed to reflect the settings you specified. Also note that the status has changed from Incomplete to Provisioning.

Once the initial provisioning has successfully completed (the remaining steps, such as puppet and func cleanup), you'll
see a hipchat notification in the builds room. Once the machine is fully provisioned, the status will change automatically
to provisioned. In the near future we'll use the contact tag to again notify you that the machine has finished the
provisioning process.

## Maintenance

On occasion you will need to put an asset into maintenance. In our environment, once you do that this triggers a few events
such as pulling the host out of any upstream proxy configurations or potentially re-generating DNS. This should generally
be something performed by people on the operations team, however there may be times when you need a machine that has had some
kind of provisioning problem occur go into maintenance so you can reprovision it. In that case, again in the actions drop down,
you can just click the start maintenance button to change the status of the machine to maintenance mode. Once in maintenance
mode you can reprovision the host if needed. If you're unsure, ask the person listed under the contact tag.

## Cancellation

Cancelling a server will cause it to be handed back to any neccesary hosting providers, and will shred the filesystem data before
doing so. This process takes 3-5 days to complete. Server cancellations should generally only be done by people on the SRE or operations
teams. Server cancellation is available in the actions drop down.

## Power Management

A variety of power management functions are available in the UI. In fact, some of these are only available in the UI. These allow
you to perform actions like soft reboots, hard reboots, powering off a machine, etc.

With great power comes great responsibility.

## Logs

The logs for an asset are created by both internal and external processes. There is an API available for creating new log
entries and querying existing ones, but log entries are immutable and permanent, there is no delete support, even once an asset
is decommissioned. These logs give you a permanent historical view of lifecycle related events such as provisions and cancellations
as well as changes in tag values.

Although in the UI you will see a few entries that say "User unknown", the user account record is actually stored and this is a UI
bug. By design, no changes or updates to an asset can happen without leaving some kind of an audit trail.

## Activation

You can activate a host in the spare pool (status is Incomplete), which will move the host into
new until it is ready for use. The UI for this is nearly identical to provisioning because the
provisioning process will run once the host is available.
