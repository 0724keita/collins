## Stuff you need

Download http://repo.tumblr.net:8888/play-2.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT.zip and unpack it.
You'll need play to do development. You do not need play/sbt/scala though to
run the application.

## Remaining TODO

 * Parsing of lshw data
 * Password, IP Address generation
 * Log data/storage/search
 * Functional tests
