## Stuff you need

Download http://repo.tumblr.net:8888/play-2.0-RC1-SNAPSHOT.zip and unpack it.
You'll need play to do development. You do not need play/sbt/scala though to
run the application.

## Remaining TODO

 * Intake for things besides servers (routers, etc)
 * LLDP info as part of IT intake stage 2
 * Lucene index for values
 * Add remaining intake steps to API
 * Documentation
 * Decent tests
 * Deployment automation
